# SNHU, CS-210: Project Showcase

Projects demonstrating core C++ principles and industry standard program design.

***

## Project Summaries:

#### Banking Application:

This project addressed practicing pseudocoding along with development of an application that handles interest growth overtime based on initial investment values and percents of growth. 

#### Clock Application:

This application combines user input and dual clock controls that track both 12 and 24 hour time simultaniously. 

#### Grocery Application:

In this project, I worked with data provided listing produce sold by a grocery store. The document was unorganized, and the core of this application was to read through the document, and then create a .dat and presents the data in histogram format to the user. Users were also provided with a means to search for specific produce items.

## Project Strengths:

All three projects helped to further my organization and design flow. The strengths in all three is through my starting with pseudocode, the organization of the classes and their methods is sounds. I can also go back and continue to review further, but I think these are in a good spot. Further, having guides for how to mark up and add notes throughout the code is another area that is strong in all three projects, and an area I could tell growth in my development style. Reflecting on using C++ in multiple industry application examples, I am pleased with my growth using Classes and Methods, commenting practices and pseudocode preparations to write larger programs like the ones shown here.

## Enhancements and Nest Steps:

For all three, and generally: I have worked with console outputs for years now. My next areas of focus to move to the next level are packaging and making the step into applications. This will mean more work with getting more comfortable with UI libraries, but this is a next step I need to take. Regarding a step I would like to take, but will take a little longer, is integrating database interaction. 

Specifically the Banking Application: It is more likely that a user would have an account, a password to acces the account, then have access to controls and seeing growth and tracking. I've only worked with databases via web site design and development. Starting the steps forward to work with databases with application development is something I'd like to further develop. However, having these applications as starting points, I think will make integrating databases easier.

## Challenges and Overcoming:

In teaching, my core languages are Java and Python. The main challenge was making the jump into the C++ syntax. There was a ton of grumbling, referencing our class ZyBook, and, "I swear this logic is the same across languages why do you not like this C++?" For all three programs and the practices in the class, there were several practices I used to overcome them including:

- Walk Away: Seriously. There were times I had to give myself 24-hours before going back and looking at the program. (This is also a 'start sooner rather than later' plug)
- Tutoring: Between colleagues and also tutoring, being able to talk through the logic was immensely helpful. I see why many companies have programmers work in teams.
- Knowing when to stop: I think this is the database designer in me. I want to break every last element of a program into a class with methods to handle ALL the things. Deadlines were extremely helpful with this.

Overall, knowing the core concepts of general programming really helped with tackling challenges I encountered. These are all things I'll often remind my students of, but doing it myself (after 20ish years) was a good reminder for tackling challenges with programming.

## Specific Code Challenges:

This I really had to think on - I guess if anything, I'd say in the Grocery Application, looping through and collecting the produce from the original text file and then writing it to a .dat file and formatting it to show the produce item and a number of that item that is available. Along that thought, for a lot of my work in the class I used CLion and then would create a Visual Studio project and rebuild the project in VS. That was probably the biggest challenge as CLion handles file reading and writing a little differently from VS (I think it's due to VS's .sln reference, I did not get too deep into it). 

Several resources I tapped into included [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp), [Microsoft's C++ Language Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/cpp-language-reference?view=msvc-170), along with several discord servers that focus on programming: [The Programmer's Hangout](https://discord.gg/programming), [The Coding Den](https://discord.gg/code), and [Code Support](https://discord.gg/codesupport-240880736851329024)
